# Simulation & Validation

## Tools
- MATLAB / Simulink for control modeling
- Proteus for circuit-level verification

## Simulated Scenarios
- Single-phase inverter validation
- Three-phase uncontrolled inverter
- Controlled SPWM inverter
- Speed and torque response analysis

## Outcome
Simulations validated control logic prior to
hardware implementation, reducing risk and cost.
