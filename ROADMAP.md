# Project Roadmap

This repository represents a prototype-level implementation of a
Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) for a 3-in-1 E-Axle system.

## Completed
- SPWM-based three-phase inverter design
- MATLAB & Proteus simulations
- Arduino-based control logic
- Prototype hardware validation
- Speed and torque control via frequency modulation

## Planned Improvements
- Integration of regenerative braking
- Closed-loop motor control using feedback sensors
- CAN bus communication with BMS and vehicle ECU
- Higher voltage and power scaling
- Thermal and fault protection mechanisms

## Long-Term Vision
- Full automotive-grade VCU
- Compliance with EV safety standards
- Integration with autonomous and smart mobility systems
