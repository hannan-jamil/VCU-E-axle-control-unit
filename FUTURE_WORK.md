# Future Work

Potential extensions of this project include:

- Integration with real EV traction motors
- Real-time speed feedback using encoders
- DSP-based control instead of microcontroller
- Regenerative braking implementation
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing
- ROS2-based digital twin for VCU validation
